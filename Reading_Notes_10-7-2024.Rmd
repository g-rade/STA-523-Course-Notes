## Webscraping

Using the SelectorGadget:

  1. To use it, open the page you want to scrape, then:

  2. Click the SelectorGadget entry in your bookmark bar.

  3. Click on the element you want to select. SelectorGadget will make a first guess at what css selector you want. It’s likely to be bad since it only has one example to learn from, but it’s a start. Elements that match the selector will be highlighted in yellow.

  4. Click on elements that shouldn’t be selected. They will turn red. Click on elements that should be selected. They will turn green.

  5. Iterate until only the elements you want are selected. SelectorGadget isn’t perfect and sometimes won’t be able to find a useful css selector. Sometimes starting from a different element helps.

html <- read_html("https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html") ## read in the web address

html %>% 
  html_element("h2") %>% 
  html_text2() ## get the title of the hilm

html %>% 
  html_elements(".crawl p") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  .[1:4] ## get the description of the film

films <- html %>% html_elements("section")
films ## list of films

films %>% 
  html_element("h2") %>% 
  html_text2() ## list of film titles

films %>% 
  html_element(".crawl") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  .[[1]] %>% 
  writeLines() ## attack of the clones summary
